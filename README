Neural Networks Class Code
Matlab/Octave Code implementing some interesting neural networks stuff

I think that one of the best pieces is the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Example.
This can show people how the output should look exactly.
Severl of the other people that were in the class at that time, got the exact same answers, to all decimal places. Thus I think it's a good representation of what MLP output looks like, when implemented properly.
